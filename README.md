# Cosmetics-REST-API

This project is still in progress :)

The idea was to create an application that would allow you to create a database of used cosmetics and review them. When testing cosmetics from various categories on ourselves, it is easy to forget after a while whether they worked for us and whether it is worth returning to them after unsuccessful attempts with other products.

The application is written in Django REST framework using containerization. In the future, I hope to learn React enough to create an aesthetically pleasing frontend.
